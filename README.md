# Experiential-Learning-Journey-with-ReMo-App
Developed an interactive dashboard and predictive models for ReMo App’s Maine Reading Awards using R and Tableau. Analyzed 20,000+ book records to uncover student reading trends, improve book selection, and drive data-informed decisions for four committees. Project highlights data cleaning, EDA, machine learning, and visualization skills.

# 📚 Maine Reading Awards Dashboard – ReMo App Project

This repository contains the work completed during my Experiential Learning program at Northeastern University, in collaboration with **ReMo App** and sponsored by **Michelle DeBlois**. The project aimed to build a predictive analytics and dashboard system to support data-driven book selection for four Maine youth reading award committees: **Chickadee**, **MSBA**, **NSYA**, and **Lupine**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

We analyzed over 20,000 book records from 2018–2024 to identify student reading preferences, voting patterns, and genre engagement. The goal was to help committees shift from intuition-based to data-driven decisions, improving student participation and reading outcomes.

## 💡 Key Features

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** (Tableau) for each committee with real-time filtering
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Integration** of multi-year, multi-source datasets
- 📈 **Predictive Modeling** using Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- 📚 **Genre & Engagement Analysis** to align book selection with student interests

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **R Programming** (dplyr, ggplot2, caret, randomForest, etc.)
- **Tableau** for dashboard design and visualization
- **Excel** for initial data exploration
- **Git** for version control

## 📁 Repository Structure!

## 📌 Insights

- Illustrated books are **17x more likely** to be voted for by young readers (Chickadee)
- Graphic Novels showed **100% success rate** in student voting (MSBA)
- Seasonal patterns drive genre popularity in NSYA committee
- Predictive models achieved up to **89% accuracy** (Lupine)
